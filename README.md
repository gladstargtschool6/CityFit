# CityFit
This is an Android app that uses Google's Activity Recognition API to detect and calculate the User's daily active time duration. It detects 6 types of activities, Walking, Running, Cycling, Swimming, driving, using mobile, and Standing. Based on this, a City Leaderboard is generated depending on the user location which allows different users to see their rank compared to others. The idea behind this app is to create an incentive for a healthier city. This Authentication is handled by Google Firebase. This app also uses the OpenWeatherMap API to show different weather conditions.
